        # Editing Your GitHub Page

        We've set you up with a project to get started with. Now let's see how to make some edits to it. If you're not clear on the GitHub workflow, we recommend that you complete the [Wheelhouse GitHub Workflow course](https://learn.wheelhouse.io/events/workflow) first. 

        ## User vs. Project Pages

        There are two kinds of GitHub Page projects: user pages, and project pages. Every personal and organizational GitHub account gets one user pages. Profile pages are displayed from the `master` branch, and so are managed just like any other GitHub project. Your user pages must have the title of `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username or the name of the organization. To see your user pages, just go to the same URL as the title, so `http://username.github.io`.

        While you can only have one user pages, you can have as many project pages as you have projects. To create a project page, create a branch on any project called `gh-pages`. The HTML, CSS, and Jekyll information there will be displayed at `http://username.github.io/project-name`. So if a user named Jamal has a project named "startup-landing-page" with a `gh-pages` branch, he'd be able to get to his site by navigating to `http://jamal.github.io/startup-landing-page` in his browser.

        In this course, we'll be walking you through creating a project page—but at any time you can make it a user page by changing the name of the project in your "settings" tab, then updating the `master` branch to be up to date with `gh-pages` by submitting and merging a pull request comparing the two.

        ## GitHub Pages and the GitHub Workflow

        Whether on a profile or project page, it's best to create a branch before you do any editing of your page. You should name the branch something related to the work that you're doing. For instance, you might want to call a branch `adding-personal-info` or `new-blog-post`. Make sure to make any edits and commits to that branch, not to `master` or `gh-pages`. 

        Then once you're ready, you'd create a Pull Request comparing your branch to `master` or `gh-pages`, and merge the branch once you're sure everything is working.

        Note that you won't be able to test your page online from your branch—you won't see it until you merge the branch. So, once it's up you may need to create a bugfix branch to touch up any rough spots. If you'd like to see your site before it goes live, you'll have to do that using Jekyll locally. We'll cover how to do that in the optional fourth section of this course as it's a little complex to get set up.

        ## Editing Content

        ### Markdown
        Editing the content of your site is as easy as writing plain text with a couple of added elements. These elements are called "markdown", and are used by Jekyll to format the text. 

        For instance, if you wrap some text in double-asterisks, `**like so**`, you'll see bold text, **like so**. A single underscore before and after some text will _italicize_ it, `_like this_`.

        Adding between one and six hash signs on a new line will make the text after it become a header.

            # Title
            ## Header
            ### Sub-Header

        You can even add links and images using markdown using the following syntax:

            [This is the text you will see.](http://link.url)

            ![This is the image alt text.](http://link.url/image.jpg)

        That's really all you need to know about markdown to get started. In the "Issues" tab at the top of your repo, you'll find a comment that explains markdown in some detail—feel free to check it out.

        ### Front Matter

        You'll notice that all of the markdown files have some code at the beginning. This code is contained within dashes, and looks something like this:

            ---
            title: Hello
            author: Jamal Phillips
            layout: blog
            ---

        This is called "front matter". It defines variables for Jekyll to use on that particular page. The word before the colon is the variable name, and text after it is the variable's value. We'll go more in depth on this later, but for right now just know that if you'd like to change the variable for a page (for instance, if you want to set your name to the author of a post), all you have to do is change the text after the colon.

        ## The Structure of a Jekyll Project

        <div class='container' data-video-url='https://youtu.be/3s2jMJo9_yM'></div>

        **Key take-aways:** 

        * The `index.html` file defines the layout of your home page. The file in the `_index` folder defines the content.
        * The `_layouts` and `_includes` folders define the layout of the rest of the pages.
        * The `_pages` folder holds the content of your pages, and `_posts` is for blog posts. To create a new page or post, you just create a markdown file here.
        * The `config.yml` file tells Jekyll about your site. It's like front matter, but for the whole site instead of a single page.

        ## Tying It All Together

        On the next page, we'll be walking you through the steps of editing the front page of your project to make it about you. You'll be editing the markdown files in the `_index` folder.
