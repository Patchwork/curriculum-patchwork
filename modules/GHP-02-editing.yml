        We've set you up with a project to get started with. Now let's see how to make some edits to it. If you're not clear on the GitHub workflow, we recommend that you complete the [Wheelhouse GitHub Workflow course](https://learn.wheelhouse.io/events/workflow) first. 


        ## Profile vs. Project Pages

        There are two kinds of GitHub Page projects: profile pages, and project pages. Every personal and organizational GitHub account gets one profile page. Profile pages are displayed from the `master` branch, and so are managed just like any other GitHub project. Your profile page must have the title of `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username or the name of the organization. To see your profile page, just go to the same URL as the title, so `http://username.github.io`.

        While you can only have one profile page, you can have as many project pages as you have projects. To create a project page, create a branch on any project called `gh-pages`. The HTML, CSS, and Jekyll information there will be displayed at `http://username.github.io/project-name`. So if a user named Jamal has a project named "startup-landing-page" with a `gh-pages` branch, he'd be able to get to his site by navigating to `http://jamal.github.io/startup-landing-page` in his browser.


        ## GitHub Pages and the GitHub Workflow

        Whether on a profile or project page, it's best to create a branch before you do any editing of your page. You should name the branch something related to the work that you're doing. For instance, you might want to call a branch `adding-personal-info` or `new-blog-post`. Make sure to make any edits and commits to that branch, not to `master` or `gh-pages`. 

        Then once you're ready, you'd create a Pull Request comparing your branch to `master` or `gh-pages`, and merge the branch once you're sure everything is working.

        Note that you won't be able to test your page online from your branch—you won't see it until you merge the branch. So, once it's up you may need to create a bugfix branch to touch up any rough spots. If you'd like to see your site before it goes live, you'll have to do that using Jekyll locally. We'll cover how to do that in the optional fourth section of this course as it's a little complex to get set up.

        ## Editing Files Using Markdown

        Editing the content of your site is as easy as writing plain text with a couple of added elements. These elements are called "markdown", and are used by Jekyll to format the text. 

        For instance, if you wrap some text in double-asterisks, `**like so**`, you'll see bold text, **like so**. A single underscore before and after some text will _italicize_ it, `_like this_`.

        Adding between one and six hash signs on a new line will make the text after it become a header.

        ```markdown
        # Title
        ## Header
        ### Sub-Header
        ```

        You can even add links and images using markdown using the following syntax:

        ```markdown
        [This is the text you will see.](http://link.url)

        ![This is the image alt text.](http://link.url/image.jpg)
        ```

        That's really all you need to know about markdown to get started. In the "Issues" tab at the top of your repo, you'll find a comment that explains markdown in some detail—feel free to check it out.

        ### Frontmatter

        You'll see that each of the markdown pages also has some code at the top of the page. This is called frontmatter, and it's used by Jekyll to render the pages. Don't worry about this for now, we'll learn more about what it does and how to use it in a future lesson. Just don't edit it, let's focus on editing the content.


        ## Tying It All Together

        On the next page, we'll be walking you through the steps of editing the front page of your project to make it about you. You'll be editing the markdown files in the `_index` folder.

        Don't worry if you don't want to put your actual information up online. It's OK to just make stuff up. But if you do want to create an actual portfolio, we'd recommend doing that here!
