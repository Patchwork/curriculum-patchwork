# Installing Jekyll Locally

This lesson will assume you know how to use Git locally on the command line. If you don't know how to do this, we'd recommend going through our Introduction to Git tutorial first.


## Jekyll on Your Computer

There are many benefits to installing Jekyll on your computer and working on your projects locally. You can more quickly test what your changes look like on the web without having to merge your branch to do so. You can start new projects from scratch instead of having to use our template. You'll be able to configure Jekyll to work for a wider variety of project types. And you can use your favorite text editor to make the process of writing your content that much faster and more pleasant.

However, Jekyll can be difficult to set up. Getting Jekyll set up locally and using GitHub pages will require several steps. Unfortunately, some of the most boring and finicky steps must come first, but you'll only need to perform them once to get started.

1. Install Ruby
2. Install Jekyll
3. Install Git
4. Instantialize a new local Git repository
5. Connect your local repo to a remote repo on GitHub
6. Use Jekyll to create a new project in that repository
7. Configure the Jekyll project based on the type of project you're building
8. Set up the templates and CSS for the project
9. Add the content
10. Push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub

You've learned to do (8), and (9) already in this course, and (3), (4), (5), and (10) in the Intro to Git course, so we'll be focusing on installing Jekyll, generating a new Jekyll project, and configuring that project.

In this lesson, instead of giving you step-by-step instructions, we're going to link you to outside tutorials that cover the different parts. It's important to learn how to read these tutorials, as reading and writing tutorials is an important way to learn about Open Source projects. 

Remember that you can always ask a mentor for help if you need it!

## Installing Jekyll

Jekyll requires that you have ruby (a programming language and environment) installed before it will work. Jekyll is designed to be run on Mac and Linux computers. It isn't officially supported on Windows. 

If you're using a Mac, <a href="http://digitalshore.io/how-to-install-jekyll-mac-osx-yosemite/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> will walk you through the steps of installing Ruby and Jekyll. You have to install Xcode, Apple's own developer environment.

If you're using Windows, you still may be able to get Jeckyll to work. <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/" target="_blank">This tutorial</a> offers a really comprehensive list of steps to take, and ways to troubleshoot any issues you come across. 

If you're using Linux, you can install Ruby and Jekyll using whichever package manager you use. 


## Generating a New Jekyll Project

Now that you have Jekyll installed, it's going to do a lot of the heavy lifting for you setting up your project. 

Using the command line, navigate to the folder that you want your Jekyll project to live in. So if you have a `/projects` folder, where each folder inside of that is its own project, you'd navigate to `/projects`.

Here, type `jekyll new project-name`, where `project-name` will be the name of your github repo. This will cause Jekyll to create a new folder with the contents of the Jeykll projectâ€”default template, CSS, and config, and content files. 

### Setting up Git

Now, navigate into the folder (`cd project-name`) and type `git init`. This sets up the folder so that it is being watched by git locally. Commit the project to the `gh-pages` branch by typing:

    $ git checkout -b gh-pages

    $ git add .

    $ git commit -m "First commit: Jekyll Project created."

Now you need to push the changes up to GitHub. On GitHub, create a new repo with the same name as your project folder. **Do not tell GitHub to automatically create a Readme file.** Once you've done that, copy the HTTPS url under the "Quick setup" section.

Now on the command line, type

    $ git remote add origin <<URL>>

    $ git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages

This connects your repo to your GitHub account, creates a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub, and pushes the Jekyll project to that branch.

From now on, just typing `git push` from this branch will push all of your local commits.
