#Introduction to GitHub Pages

## What is GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a service that lets you host a website for free, using Git and GitHub to manage the content of your website.

With Pages you can either upload HTML and CSS files, or use a service called Jekyll which lets you build templates and populate them with markdown. Markdown is a formatting language that is incredibly easy to read and write, making adding pages, blog posts, or changing the content of your Jekyll site fast and easy.

### Uses for GitHub Pages

People use GitHub Pages for a variety of reasons. Initially, it was built to allow people to host their own GitHub profile pages and websites for specific GitHub projects. You'll see this reflected in some of the design choices that we'll teach you about.

However, GitHub Pages can be used to host any sort of static website or blog. Use it as a content management system, to advertise a small business, to write a serialized novel, or to build a fan site for your favorite K-Pop star. 


## This Course

In this couse, we're going to walk you through adding content to a pofile page using GitHub Pages. By the end of the course, you'll have a fully functioning profile page hosted on your GitHub account that you built yourself.

Once you've completed that project, we'll also show you how to edit the design of the profile. This will assume you have knowledge of HTML and CSS. Finally, we'll show you how to generate your own Jekyll sites from scratch and configure them to run differnt types of projects. This will assume some knowledge of the command line. But to learn the basics of editing Jekyll sites on GitHub and to get your profile page finished, no prior experience that is needed is an understanding of the Branching GitHub Workflow. 

If you don't know how to branch and merge, we'd suggest you do the GitHub Workflow course first, and then come back to this course.

All right, let's begin!
