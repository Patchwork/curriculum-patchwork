# GitHub Pages

## What is GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a service that lets you host a website for free, using the Git version control system to manage the content of your site and the GitHub website to publish it online.

With GitHub Pages you could just build a site from scratch and upload the HTML and CSS files to host them on GitHub. However, most people use a piece of software called Jekyll. Jekyll lets you create HTML and CSS templates for describing the look and feel of your site and then add the content to the pages using a simpler format called Markdown. Markdown is a formatting language that is incredibly easy to read and write, making adding pages, blog posts, or otherwise changing the content of your Jekyll site quick and easy.

## This Course

In this couse, we're going to walk you through adding content to a profile page using GitHub Pages. By the end of the course, you'll have a fully functioning profile page hosted on your GitHub account that you built yourself.

Once you've completed that project, we'll also show you how to edit the design of the profile. This will assume you have knowledge of HTML and CSS. Finally, we'll show you how to generate your own Jekyll sites from scratch and configure them to run differnt types of projects. This will assume some knowledge of the command line. But to learn the basics of editing Jekyll sites on GitHub and to get your profile page finished, the only prior experience that is needed is an understanding of the Branching GitHub Workflow. 

If you don't know how to branch and merge, we'd suggest you do the GitHub Workflow course first, and then come back to this course.

**To complete this course, you'll need to fork <a href='https://github.com/wheelhouseio/project-gh-pages' target='_blank'>the coure project</a>** to your own repo. To do that, follow the link, then click on the `Fork` button on the top-right of the page. All work that you do in the course will be done in the new, forked repo, on the `gh-pages` branch.

Go ahead and fork the repo, then let's begin!
