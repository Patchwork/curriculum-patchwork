# Doing Work on GitHub

## Branches

In GitHub, a branch is a working copy of your project. Everything in your project lives on a branch.

By convention, the default branch is a repository is called `master`. Master is typically the deployed, production copy of your code. When you are ready to make changes or add a new feature to your project, you will create a new branch to avoid introducing bugs in your production code. At the end of the GitHub workflow, this branch will be merged back into `master`.

When you create a branch, you are creating a full copy of the parent branch and giving it a new, unique name. From that point on edits made to one branch _will not_ show up on the parent until you merge the branches back together.

### Using Branches Effectively

It is common to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given timeâ€”some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

Any time you want to start a new chunk of work, you should create a new branch for that work. 

Each branch you create should exist to introduce a single feature or fix a single bug. You want to create short-lived, single-purpose branches that can easily be merged (or reverted) later.

Here is a video walk-through of how to create a branch on GitHub:

##Commiting

Committing is how you take a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Commits are added to the current branch and can include changes to one or more files.

Commits always have a brief message associated with them. The commit message is a description of the changes introduced in this snapshot. Think of it as the story of your project, 50 characters at a time. 

Here's a short video on creating, editing, and commiting files on GitHub:

## Try it Out

Now it is your turn to walk through the GitHub Workflow. Start by creating a branch and adding a new file to your repository.

We have set up <a href='https://github.com/wheelhouseio/workflow-project' target='_blank'>a project</a> that you can fork and use for the steps below. 

* Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/wheelhouseio/workflow-project" target="_blank">the project</a>.
* Fork the project by clicking on the `Fork` button in the upper-right hand corner.
* Once it's finished, look around. This is the Code Veiw, where all your code in the repo is stored.
* In the upper left, click on the drop down next to `Branch: master`. This is where you can create new branches, or switch to another branch.
* Create a branch called `create-bio`.
* On the `create-bio` branch, create a file called `new-file.md`. Include the following text:
  ```
  This is a new file.
  * It is formatted using markdown.
  * That's why it has the `.md` file extension.
  ```
* Add a commit message and commit the file directly to your branch.
